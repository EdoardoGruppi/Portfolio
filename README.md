# Project starting point

Welcome to my newest portfolio project on GitHub! A portfolio is a collection of works that showcases a developer's technical skills and experience. In this portfolio, you will find a variety of web applications and other software projects, each designed to highlight different aspects of my abilities as a developer. The projects use a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. Please feel free to explore this portfolio and get in touch if you have any questions!

The portfolio skeleton is significantly inspired by the following template: https://github.com/codewithsadee/smith-portfolio.
